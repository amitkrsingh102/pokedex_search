# Pokedex

## Introduction
This was a fun and interesting project to do. I had always wanted to create a Pokedex application, but never had any reason to, until now!

This project is made using Django and React.js for the back-end and front-end respectfully. Libraries such as Tensorflow have also been used to create models to help determine Pokemon using image search

## Pre-Requisites
- Python 3.x
- Django
- Tensorflow
- Node
